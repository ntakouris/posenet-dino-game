## Instructions

Download this repository, use latest chrome to open `index.html`.
Open the webcam, scroll down till you can see the dino game.
Make sure that the bottom text says 'idle'
*Physically* jump and crouch to play.
__Latest chrome is only supported, sorry.__

## Notes

This is a very naive approach to using a PoseNet and thresholds on the hip landmarks, to tell if someone if jumping or not. There is much room for improvement, but it's ultimately a fun way to play the game.
